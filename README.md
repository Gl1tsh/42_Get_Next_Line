# GET_NEXT_LINE

The Get Next Line project at 42 school is a crucial step in the journey of learning C programming. Its main objective is to familiarize students with reading text files line by line using a function they must implement themselves, called get_next_line.

This project highlights several key concepts in C programming, including:

- *Input/Output Handling*: Students must master opening, reading, and closing files using functions from the C standard library, such as fopen, fgets, and fclose.

- *Pointer Manipulation*: Correct use of pointers is essential for navigating through the file content, keeping track of the current reading position, and moving the cursor appropriately to read the next line.

- *Dynamic Memory Management*: Since the length of text lines in a file may vary, students must dynamically allocate memory to store each read line. They must also free this memory properly to avoid memory leaks.

- *Code Modularity*: The project encourages students to divide their implementation into modular functions, making the code easier to maintain and more readable and reusable.

- *Handling Edge Cases*: Students must be able to effectively handle situations such as end-of-file, empty lines, and files containing only a single line.

In summary, the Get Next Line project is a crucial step in learning C programming at 42 school. It allows students to strengthen their skills in various aspects of programming, including file manipulation, memory management, and code modularity. This project also prepares students for more complex challenges in the field of system programming by providing a solid foundation in handling data streams in C.
